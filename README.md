# blog-vanilla
I'm building a blog application for my articles, and the first step was to create a base structure and CSS. Later I will use this, to create the same look within ReactJS.

I wanted to have a very minimalistic look, so I used black and white (I've tried to change black to dark grey and white for light grey for better visibility, but I like this look much better). I've also added some color with text gradient effect in hover. The side-navbar is a must, and I want that to jump on the top on mobil view, and have a sticky top nav instead of the usual hamburger menu. As I have very few menu links here, I think this will work.
